""" Helpers for creating input reco sequences

Classes:
    AlgInputConfig - base class for individual input configs
    InputConfigRegistry - class to gather input configurations together

Together, these classes implement a rudimentary dependency resolution method.
The main unit in this are the inputs being created. These are referred to by
nicknames rather than the container names directly as these can vary depending
on the reconstruction parameters provided. For example, the clusters input
config creates the "Clusters" input. This corresponds to a StoreGate key of
'HLT_TopoCaloClustersFS' if the cluster calibration is 'em' and
'HLT_TopoCaloClustersLCFS' if the cluster calibration is 'lcw'.

This file just provides the underlying mechanisms. For the concrete example see
METRecoSequences, which will be referenced in the following explanation.

Each config declares the inputs it will produce and on what inputs it depends.
The dependencies are allowed to be different for different reco configurations
but for simplicity's sake the inputs produced are always the same. For example
the jet input config in METRecoSequences produces ["Jets", "JetDef"] and its
dependencies are ["Clusters"] if no tracks are needed and ["Clusters", "Tracks"
"Vertices"] otherwise.

Each config also has a create_sequence method which builds the actual reco
sequence. This method returns a two-tuple. The first element is the reco
sequence which makes the inputs, the second is a dictionary mapping the produced
input's nicknames to their values. These values are usually storegate keys but
can be any object. For example, the jet input config (with the correct reco
configuration) would produce
{
    "Jets" : "HLT_AntiKt4EMTopoJets_subjesIS",
    "JetDef" : jetdef
}
for this mapping, where jetdef is a python object produced by the jet reco
sequence.

The dependency resolution is done by the InputConfigRegistry class. This
maintains a list of known input configs where no two can claim to produce the
same input. The main one used here is the default_inputs object created in
METRecoSequences. The 'build_steps' method is then used to create the necessary
sequences in the correct order, split into their steps and also to collate and 
return the mapping of input nicknames to values.

The same system is also used for component-accumulator based configuration.
