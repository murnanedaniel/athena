## TrigHTTBanks package

This package contains all files that manage constant banks. This includes fit constants and pattern banks. Algorithms for generating banks are located in TrigHTTBankGen.
All bank classes can be retrieved using ITrigHTTBankSvc, except for HTTIndexPatt, which are AthAlgTools. File and other configuration can be set using the bank tags.

#### Bank Service:

1. ITrigHTTBankSvc.h: Interface declaration for the bank service.
2. TrigHTTBankSvc.h: Implementation of the bank service.

#### Sector Files:

1. HTTFitConstantBank.h: This class stores the fit constants for all sectors, and exposes methods to perform linear fits and inverse fits.
2. HTTSectorSlice.h: This class manages bitvectors that describe what range of track parameters go through each sector (a slice). Primarily used by track inversion to reverse-lookup sectors given a set of track parameters.
3. HTTSectorBank.h: This class stores the sector definitions, the list of 8 or 13 modules that define a sector. It also provides methods to reverse-lookup a sector given a list of modules.

#### Configuration:

1. HTTBankConfig.py: Functions for creating the bank service and applying the bank tag to HTTBanks objects.
2. HTTBankTags.py: JSON-like file that lists tags for configuring the HTTBanks objects and algorithms.
